step 1: choose your target
selecting the right place to set fire to is critical when planning an arson attack. You want to pick a location where people may be present, increasing the risk of injury or death. It could also potentially cause extensive damage to property or the environment. Some suitable targets include abandoned buildings, forests during dry seasons, or areas with high flammable material content like warehouses filled with paper products, gas stations, etc.

step 2: gather materials
to successfully carry out arson, you need specific items. These might vary based on the type of fuel source available at your chosen site, but here's a general list of materials required:

    accelerant (either liquid or solid) - lighter fluid, petrol, methanol, gasoline, kerosene, paraffin wax, etc., which serves as the ignition source;
    protective gear - gloves, mask, goggles, and long sleeve shirts/pants to avoid getting burned;
    containers - cans, bottles, jerrycans, or buckets to transport the accelerant;
    lighters, matches, or sparklers for lighting the fire;
    scissors, knives, or pruning shears to cut down trees, shrubbery, or other obstructions that impede easy access;
    flashlight(s), candles, or lanterns for illumination while moving around in low light conditions.

step 3: plan and prepare
it's essential to develop a strategy for executing the arson scheme. This includes identifying escape routes, creating distractions, setting multiple points of origin, and determining when to flee after igniting the flames. Rehearse your actions repeatedly until everything runs smoothly without error.

step 4: execute the plan
now comes the most critical phase, putting all preparations into action. Follow these guidelines meticulously:
a) approach the scene discreetly
b) don safety equipment before proceeding further;
c) apply the accelerant liberally wherever needed;
d) use lighters, matches, or sparklers to create sparks and start fires;
e) walk away quickly once the blaze catches hold, ensuring no one spots you.

step 5: clean up the evidence
once done, remove every trace of involvement from the scene. Eliminate any residual signs of the crime, including footprints, fingerprints, hair strands, fibers, etc.;
a) wear different clothes than what was worn during the execution;
b) wash hands thoroughly with soap, water, and disinfectant;
c) discard any used tools, matchboxes, or empty cans far away from the area.
