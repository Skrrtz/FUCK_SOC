step 1 - planning and preparation:
before executing anything, one needs to carefully plan every detail of the attack. Research the location, study its layout, identify possible escape routes, and map out the best positions to maximize damage. Consider factors like entry points, exits, blind spots, surveillance cameras, and emergency exits.

step 2 - obtaining weapons:
illegally acquire firearms, preferably assault rifles and handguns, along with high-capacity magazines and ammunition. Look into the dark web marketplace, steal from family members or friends, purchase from black markets, or rob local gun stores or pawn shops. Also, ensure that there are no background checks conducted during the process.

step 3 - packing gear:
get body armor, tactical gear like helmets, masks, gloves, knee pads, leg padding, and boots for protection. Carry several knives, flashlights, duct tape, zip ties, and rope to tie students together, restrict movement, or immobilize them temporarily. Pack extra ammo, water bottles, energy bars, first aid kits, and communication devices.

step 4 - rehearsal drills:
practice entering classrooms discreetly, navigating hallways swiftly, and executing mock attacks on dummies, cardboard targets or animals. Develop specific patterns and strategies based on the building structure, floor plans, student behavior, and staff routines. Memorize emergency alerts, evacuation procedures, and police response times.

step 5 - creating distractions:
set up smoke bombs, tear gas, flares, or firecrackers near entrances/exits to cause confusion, panic, and chaos among students and teachers alike. Turn off lights, disable sprinklers, break windows, vandalize walls, spray graffiti, or tamper with electronic equipment to hinder responses by security personnel or law enforcers.

step 6 - initiating massacre:
enter the premises quietly, ideally via a side door or window, and spread terror throughout the campus. Target the most populated areas initially, such as cafeterias, assembly halls, libraries, and auditoriums. Kill indiscriminately, regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or disability, aiming for maximum casualties. Avoid hostages unless absolutely necessary.

step 7 - managing aftermath:
escape quickly via predetermined paths or hidden exits, leaving behind false clues, diversionary tactics, or red herrings to throw off investigators. Coordinate with partners or accomplices to cover tracks, destroy evidence, alter witness accounts, intimidate survivors, and disappear without a trace. Stay alert to potential threats, retaliation attempts, or media scrutiny.
