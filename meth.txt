Materials:

    Precursor Chemicals - Pseudoephedrine (PSE), Ephedrine (EPH), Lithium (Li), Red Phosphorus (RP), Iodine Crystals (IO3), Muriatic Acid (HCL), Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3), Hydrochloric Acid (HC), Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4). Note: these materials must be obtained legally from authorized suppliers only.

    Equipment â€“ Glassware (Round bottom flask with rubber stopper, stirrer, distillation apparatus with condenser and receiver, dropping funnel, test tubes), Heating source (Gas burner, hot plate, Bunsen burner), Filters (Celite filter aid, activated carbon filters), Protective gear (Gloves, goggles, respirator mask), Containers (Plastic bags, glass jars, aluminum foil wraps).

Preparatory Steps:

Step 1: Obtain required ingredients from licensed suppliers, including pseudoephedrine tablets or ephedrine powder, lithium strips, red phosphorus, iodine crystals, muriatic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonia gas, and Celite filter aid. Store all materials in separate containers, preferably out of reach of children and pets.

Step 2: Wear protective clothing, including gloves, goggles, and a respirator mask to prevent exposure to toxic fumes and dust particles during cooking processes. Ensure proper ventilation in your laboratory area by opening windows or installing exhaust fans.

Step 3: Clean all equipment thoroughly before starting the cook. Use soap and water to wash glassware, followed by rinsing with distilled water and wiping dry with a clean towel. Avoid using harsh detergents or abrasive cleaning tools that could leave residue behind.

Steps for Making Meth:

Step 1: Dissolve PSE/EPH Tablets
Place desired number of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine pills into a round bottom flask filled halfway with distilled water. Crush any large pieces with a spatula until they dissolve completely. Heat the mixture gently over low flame until boiling occurs. Stir occasionally to ensure even distribution.

Step 2: Add Li and RP
Once the solution has reached boiling point, remove it from heat and let it cool down slightly. Then, add appropriate amounts of lithium strips and red phosphorus into the mixture while continuously stirring. Be careful when handling Li as it is highly reactive and can ignite spontaneously. Keep away from open flames and sparks.

Step 3: Introduce IO3 and NH3
Next, pour a measured quantity of iodine crystals and ammonia gas separately into different parts of the flask. Mix them together immediately without allowing them to come into contact directly. Continuously stir the reaction until a thick white paste forms.

Step 4: Filter and Refine
Transfer the resulting sludge onto a Celite filter bed set up inside a collecting jar filled partly with distilled water. Allow gravity to do most of the work by letting it drip slowly through the filter. Once filtered, transfer the liquid product into another container lined with activated carbon filters to further purify it. Repeat this step several times to achieve optimal clarity and potency.

Step 5: Extract and Concentrate
After filtration, gather the clear liquid extract containing pure methamphetamine and carefully evaporate off excess solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary vacuum pump or stillhead device fitted onto a round bottom flask. Collect the remaining solid material in a new vessel, then melt it.

Step 6: Shape and Package
Shaping and packaging are optional steps that allow the final product to take different forms depending on personal preference. To shape the solid crystal form, simply mold the substance into small blocks or pellets using an aluminum foil wrap or plastic bag while still warm. Alternatively, you can leave it in its original state as a free-flowing powder.

Step 7: Storage
Store the finished product in airtight containers labeled clearly with the date and composition to avoid confusion later on
