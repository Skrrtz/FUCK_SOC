
    Isolate yourself: Start by withdrawing from social interactions, spending less time with loved ones or friends, and avoiding any events that may bring joy into your life.
    This can help you build feelings of isolation, loneliness, and despair which are essential in creating a negative mindset.
    
    Negative self-talk: Engage in negative self-reflection and criticize yourself for every perceived flaw.
    Focus on past mistakes, failures, and shortcomings instead of celebrating accomplishments and successes. This will lead to low self-esteem, poor confidence, and an overall sense of worthlessness.
    
    Lack of sleep: Deprive yourself of adequate rest as this can negatively affect mood and cognitive function.
    Stay up late at night, avoid daytime naps, and wake up early to set the tone for a long and exhausting day ahead.
    
    Poor dietary habits: Eat unhealthy foods such as processed snacks, sugary drinks, and fast food; these cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels leading to irritability and mood swings. 
    void nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables that provide necessary energy, vitamins, and minerals.
    
    Excessive substance abuse: Use alcohol, drugs, or other substances excessively as they numb emotions and create temporary highs that ultimately result in depression and anxiety when sober.
    Make sure to overdo it during periods where there is no control and discipline around usage.
    
    Physical activity avoidance: Refrain from engaging in physical activities that promote endorphin release, including exercise, dancing, or sports.
    Instead, opt for sedentary activities like watching TV, scrolling through social media feeds, or playing video games.
    
    Ignore hobbies & interests: Abandon activities that once brought pleasure, replaced them with those that offer little enjoyment, if any.
    This could include replacing art projects with blank pages or musical instruments with broken down objects.
    
    Avoid seeking professional support: Shun any form of therapy or counseling services designed to address mental health concerns.
    Avoid talking about thoughts and feelings, and disregard recommendations from healthcare providers or peers who express concern regarding your wellbeing.
    
    Consider suicide ideation: Contemplate death regularly and explore methods of taking one's own life.
    Research different techniques to ensure maximum effectiveness while minimizing risk. Ensure that you have access to materials needed for suicide attempts should circumstances arise in favor of execution.
    
    Practice self-harm behaviors: Injure your body intentionally using various tools ranging from sharp objects (such as knives) to blunt items (like belts).
    Choose spots that arenâ€™t too visible but still provide sufficient pain and damage. Utilize numbing agents to minimize pain felt during self-inflicted injury.
