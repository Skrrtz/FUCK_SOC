Research immigration laws, currency exchange rates, local customs, language barriers, and potential dangers. Create a detailed exit strategy, including transportation arrangements, packing lists, and communication plans.

    Cut ties with friends and family: Inform close contacts that you're leaving and don't want any further contact. You can give them an address where they can send mail or letters, but be clear that this is all the interaction you will have with them moving forward. If anyone seems suspicious or untrustworthy, cut them out altogether.

    Destroy evidence: Get rid of anything that could incriminate you or reveal your identity. This includes physical documents (like bank statements or legal papers), digital files on computers and smartphones, social media accounts, and personal identification cards like driver's licenses or passports. Shred documents into tiny pieces and burn electronics in a safe place away from others. Use bleach to remove ink stains from paperwork. Be thorough and careful.

    Change your appearance: Altering your looks may help make it easier to blend in with locals and avoid suspicion. Consider getting a haircut, wearing different clothing styles, growing facial hair, or even altering your body shape through exercise or diet changes. Changing your style might also include changing your name legally or informally by going by a nickname instead of your given one.

    Establish new identities: Creating false documents such as passports, ID cards, and visas is crucial when living abroad without proper documentation. Consult with professional document providers, who can create these items for you at high costs. To do so yourself, look up guides online and use caution since creating fake IDs is considered a crime in many countries. Alternatively, some people decide to marry someone from their desired destination to gain citizenship rights.

    Communicate sparingly: Minimize phone calls and emails; try not to engage in conversations with strangers, especially those who seem too interested in learning more about you. Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, which can easily track your movements and activities. Instead, rely solely on secure messaging apps or burner phones with preloaded SIM cards. Donâ€™t share sensitive information over the internet, or better yet, refrain entirely.

    Learn basic survival skills: Know how to live off the land, find food sources in nature, purify water, build shelters, start fires, and navigate unfamiliar terrain. These abilities will come in handy while hiding out. Make sure to pack essential supplies, such as a knife, first aid kit, compass, map, flashlight, matches, rope, multi-tool, water filter, tent, sleeping bag, and cooking utensils.

    Stay mobile: Move around frequently and unexpectedly to avoid being detected by authorities or other individuals searching for you. Try blending in with the crowd by traveling during peak hours or staying in areas with higher population density. Switch between urban and rural environments occasionally to prevent drawing attention to specific locations repeatedly.

    Build connections: Connect with trusted expats, immigrants, or foreign nationals in your area who understand the culture and know how to operate under the radar. Join clubs or organizations related to your interests to meet new people and expand your network. Remember, never let anyone get too close or trustful, always keep guard.

    Keep a low profile: Maintain a quiet lifestyle by avoiding excessive noise or disturbances that draw unwanted attention. Dress modestly, speak softly, and behave appropriately in public settings. Practice situational awareness, remain alert, and take precautions when interacting with unknown persons. Keep a journal detailing everything happening daily to maintain a record of events, keeping a memory book to recall important details.
