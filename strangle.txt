
    Guillotine Choke - This technique involves compressing the carotid artery located in the neck, causing loss of consciousness due to lack of oxygen supply to the brain. Hereâ€™s how to perform this move:
    a) Stand behind your target and wrap your right arm around their neck, bringing your left hand up between their shoulder blades (back of head).
    b) Use your hands to apply pressure by pulling downwards firmly but steadily, pushing your elbows together until they touch your sides.
    c) Hold onto the position tightly until your victim passes out. Ensure you don't release your grip till medical help arrives.

    Blood choke - Similar to a guillotine choke, except instead of focusing solely on the carotid arteries, this method targets both the arteries and veins at the front of the neck. To execute this hold:
    a) Start by gripping the trachea (windpipe) from below the jawline with one hand while grabbing the opposite side of the neck with your other hand.
    b) Pull back and squeeze simultaneously until you hear your adversary gasping for breath. Keep applying pressure until he/she loses consciousness.

    Sleeper Hold - This hold puts significant pressure on the vagus nerve, which controls vital bodily functions like heart rate and breathing. Here's how to implement this maneuver:
    a) Grasp the opponent's neck from behind with both arms wrapped tightly around his throat.
    b) Slide your hands underneath the chin and lift them off the ground, raising the head backward so that the person's eyes roll upward.
    c) Push the elbow into the collarbone of your target, forcing him/her to pass out. Release immediately after fainting, as holding too long could lead to permanent damage.
    
    Face Claw Technique - Although not technically a strangulation hold, this defense mechanism can temporarily disable the attacker. Place two fingers directly beneath each eye socket, digging deep enough to feel bone. Then, pull sharply downward until the aggressor feels intense pain in their skull, rendering them unable to continue fighting.
