step 1: establish trust
in order to have control over someone, you need them to believe that they can rely on you. Start by being consistently dependable, follow through with your promises, listen actively when they speak, and show genuine interest in their well-being. This creates an environment where they feel safe opening up to you and confiding in you.

step 2: identify vulnerabilities
observe the person closely and take note of their weaknesses, fears, and insecurities. Use these insights to understand how to leverage these areas to influence them more easily. For example, if someone is afraid of losing their job, use that fear to make them more compliant with your requests at work.

step 3: create indebtedness
make small favors or gifts early on, which makes it harder for them to refuse further requests later on. Asking for help from time to time also puts them in a position of feeling obligated to return the favor eventually. It could be something as simple as buying lunch occasionally or helping them out with some task.

step 4: isolate from other influences
try to limit their social circle, so that they spend more time around you instead of others who might challenge your authority or question your motives. Encourage them to cut off contact with people whom you consider negative influences and replace those relationships with new ones centered around you.

step 5: apply guilt trips
use emotional appeals such as making them feel guilty for past wrongdoings or accusing them of letting you down, thus triggering feelings of obligation and remorse. This tactic often works because individuals tend to prioritize repairing damaged relationships rather than standing firm on their beliefs.

step 6: play mind games
employ subtle techniques like gaslighting or confusing statements to sow seeds of doubt and uncertainty within the individual. Make them second guess themselves frequently, causing them to look towards you for clarity and guidance.

step 7: offer rewards and consequences
offer incentives for compliance but simultaneously threaten punishments for disobedience. Make sure that both are significant enough to warrant consideration while still reasonable enough to avoid suspicion or backlash. These scenarios reinforce positive behaviors and discourages negative ones accordingly.
